Our mission at ZamRock Projects is to discover and promote rare and lost ZamRock music, as well as other rare genres, through a wide variety of mix tapes. As such, we provide pirate radio services, including 24/7 internet radio, podcasts, videos, a website, and a Discord server [with bridge!]. Our goal is to create a platform that amplifies underrepresented music, challenges the status quo in the fatcat corporate music industry, and is another thorn in capitalist oppression.

A brief overview of ZamRock:
ZamRock emerged in the late 1960s and gained popularity in Zambia during the 1970s. It is a unique fusion of rock music with traditional Zambian sounds and influences from Western psychedelic rock and funk. Bands like WITCH (We Intend To Cause Havoc), Ngozi Family, and Musi-O-Tunya were pioneers in this genre, blending local rhythms, guitar-driven melodies, and political lyrics. ZamRock represented an era of social and cultural change in Zambia, mirroring the spirit of independence and expressing disillusionment with post-colonial realities. Its sound continues to inspire and fascinate music enthusiasts worldwide.
