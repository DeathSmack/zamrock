# Welcome to ZamRock Projects

> Our mission at ZamRock Projects is to discover and promote rare and yet to be found ZamRock music. Although we like a lot of other rare genres, and play a wide variety via Mixtapes.  Our goal is to create a platform that amplifies underrepresented music, challenges the status quo in the fatcat corporate music industry, and is another thorn in capitalist oppression. As such, we provide pirate radio services, including 24/7 internet radio, podcasts, videos, small but good cdn achives, website & Discord server, with bridge!

## Discover Rare ZamRock Music

> Discover the unique fusion of traditional Zambian sounds with rock, psychedelic, and funk influences. ZamRock emerged in the late 1960s and gained popularity in Zambia during the 1970s. Pioneering bands such as WITCH (We Intend To Cause Havoc), Ngozi Family, and Musi-O-Tunya blended local rhythms, guitar-driven melodies, and politically charged lyrics. ZamRock represented an era of social and cultural change in Zambia, reflecting the spirit of independence and expressing disillusionment with post-colonial realities. Let ZamRock inspire and fascinate music enthusiasts worldwide.
