It looks great but there's some little bugs
not all the pages buttons are the same, some are missing a button
lets change order to so every page has this for buttons- News, Scheduale, contact, about
the main title text 'ZamRock Radio' should be a link to home page except for heading on home page
the buttons work better on mobile but they use most the screen so a lot of empty space in button, can you keep button a stanard size that will just be a little longer than the logest text for button?
maybe on mobile it be better to align those to the right after you fix?
or stagarard left then right, you pick what you think will look best for that.
the conact page footer looks the best but i dont think I need quick links so take that out and make that the default footer for all pages

the tag line for radio is ᘔᗩᗰᘔᗩᗰ ᖴOᖇ ᒪIᖴE...
so try find appopiate place to add, like subtitle for main title at top of landing page and others

the background broke on most pages too, it should work just like landing page and use the same urls too

also some pages still have some css you put in by mistake, please make sure all css is in css files so its proper code

please apply the fixes


yes fix the lint error
most pages the buttons are broken and its just hyperlink text
all pages need same button order too
Schedule, News, Contact, About
I think the nav shoul be saved somewhere all files can ref too, so later on I can adjust add/del buttons in one place
backgrounds still only work on landing page please fix that too

none of this is changing much why isn't the title a link too landing I've must asked like 6 times? whats wrong?
you changed layout of news on landing change it back
fix the backgrounds this should not be so hard
mobile still has menu looking thing on it
should just be buttons no menu to hold them
